## Abstract

The NextGen-Core paved the way for a simpler and faster core. Bears can
be run easily and provide results in a centralized result callback.

A main goal of coala is to avoid file I/O as much as possible for maximum
performance. This is especially important for caching mechanisms, when
coala is run multiple times in a row on only minor changes in files.

To better conform with this goal, the implementation of the ignore-ranges
feature has to be redesigned.

## Goal

Currently, coala loads all files beforehand and tries to identify ignore
ranges and run the bears after. This proposal uses a different approach:
Ignore ranges are analyzed as soon as results arrive in the result callback.
When a result arrives, carrying `affected_code` to denote affected code ranges,
the new algorithm now starts from that point. A search for ignore-statements
is started at each file mentioned in `affected_code` at the marked position.
The file is scanned completely for ignore-statements or until ignore-ranges
were found that already identify the result as ignored. All found ignore-ranges
or statements are put into a global object managing ignore-ranges. This allows
to quickly reuse ignore statements for the next result.

The ignore-ranges shall be also cached, so when coala runs with a bear-cache
consecutively, file I/O can be avoided completely. The cached data is stored
together with the bear-cache on disk when coala exits.
The same cache mechanism from the NextGen-Core can be reused here.

## Implementation Details

[TODO - Search algorithm and ignore-range-manager object]

To play well with the future `FileProxy`/`FileFactory` class bears are going to
use, which supports processing binary files as well as text files, a few
adoptions have to be done:
- If the source range object passed in `affected_code` [TODO: No this is wrong, line=None means whole file, if there's any ignore range affecting us in there, we have to ignore the result]

## Prototype

```python
from enum import Enum, unique
from collections import namedtuple
import re
from functools import total_ordering


@total_ordering
class Position:
    def __init__(self, line: int, column: int):
        self.line = line
        self.column = column

    def __eq__(self, other):
        pass

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.line < other.line or (self.line == other.line and self.column < other.column)


class FileProxy:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        with open(name) as fl:
            self.contents = fl.read()

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.name == other.name


class Range:
    def __init__(self, start: Position, stop: Position, file: FileProxy = None):
        self.start = start
        self.stop = stop
        self.file = file

    def inside(self, other):
        return self.file == other.file and self.start >= other.start and self.stop <= other.stops


IgnoreMatch = namedtuple('IgnoreMatch', 'typ origins')
IgnoreMatchOrigin = namedtuple('IgnoreMatchOrigin', 'bear rule')


@unique
class IgnoreType(Enum):
    START = 0
    STOP = 1
    INLINE = 2


class IgnoreMatcher:
    # TODO Support more advanced syntax with "and" and commas
    rgx = re.compile(r'(?:(start|stop) )?ignor(?:e|ing) (.+)$', re.IGNORECASE)
    bear_rgx = re.compile(r'(\w+)(?: *(?:\((.+?)\)))?')

    @classmethod
    def match(cls, line):
        match = cls.rgx.search(line)

        if match is None:
            return None

        typ_dict = {
            'start': IgnoreType.START,
            'stop': IgnoreType.STOP,
        }

        typ = (IgnoreType.INLINE
               if match.group(1) is None else
               typ_dict[match.group(1).lower()])

        origins = tuple(
            IgnoreMatchOrigin(bear=m.group(1), rule=m.group(2))
            for m in cls.bear_rgx.finditer(match.group(2))
        )

        return IgnoreMatch(typ=typ, origins=origins)


class IgnoreRangeManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ignores = []

    def is_ignored(self, range):
        # One based convention, which we benefit from now because in zero-based
        # notation this means "this-line inclusive".
        scan_start = range.start.line

        # Why first searching for starts instead of stops? This allows starting
        # to ignore the file but not stopping it again. That effectively means
        # that the rest of the file is ignored.
        # FIXME This can be heavily optimized by exploiting special FileProxy
        # FIXME   functions that are designed to efficiently iterate over lines in files.
        for i, line in reversed(enumerate(range.file.contents.splitlines()[:scan_start])):
            ignore = IgnoreMatcher.match(line)

            if ignore is not None:
                self.ignores.append(ignore)  # TODO Line information missing
```
